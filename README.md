# Powershell Toolbox

Original idea from IntrntPirate https://github.com/intrntpirate/Toolbox  
This version reduces his multi-file Powershell Studio project into 1 file drastically reducing the code footprint from 30,000 lines of code to (currently) under 6,000 lines.

Fixed some issues found with the original release and introduced some functions which were removed from the public release of IntrntPirates version.
